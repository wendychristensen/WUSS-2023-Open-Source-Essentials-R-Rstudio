## Exercise

Do the following five things in order:

1. Create a code chunk below this list

2. In that code chunk, write code that saves two new values:

predicted = 10 (i.e., object name is "predicted", value is 10)

mean = 15 (i.e., object name is "mean", value is 15)

3. After defining the two new values, subtract mean from predicted, then square
the result. Save the result into a new value named 'sqdev'. Ensure that the value
of sqdev is visible in the Console. 

4. Add this statement to the code chunk as a comment: "This is a 
squared deviation."

5. Run the code chunk and verify that you get the quantity you expect (25)
