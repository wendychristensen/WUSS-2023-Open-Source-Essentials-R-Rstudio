## Exercise

Do the following three things in order:

1. Create a code chunk below this list

2. In that code chunk, save two new values:

predicted = 10

mean = 15

3. After defining the two new values, subtract mean from predicted, then square
the result. Save the result into a new value named 'sqdev'. Ensure that the value
of sqdev is visible in the Console. 

4. Add this statement to the code chunk as a comment: "This is a 
squared deviation."

5. Run the code chunk and verify that you get the quantity you expect (25)


```{r}

predicted = 10

mean = 15

sqdev = (predicted - mean)^2 # This is a squared deviation

sqdev

```
