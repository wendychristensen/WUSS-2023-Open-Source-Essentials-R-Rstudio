Run the code chunk before starting on the exercises

```{r}

presentations = data.frame(Presenter = c(10,10,10,11,12,13,14,14,15,16)
, Minutes = c(5,15,15,5,30,30,15,15,30,15), MaterialsReceived = c("Yes", "No", "No","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes"))

```

1. Use the ifelse() function to create a new variable named Length. 
Presentations that are less than 30 minutes should be considered "short" and
those that are 30 minutes should be considered "long".

```{r}

presentations$Length <- ifelse(presentations$Minutes < 30, "short", "long")

```


2. Use the subset() function to create a new data object named "contact" that
contains only the rows from presentations where MaterialsReceived is "No"

```{r}

contact <- subset(presentations, MaterialsReceived == "No")

```
